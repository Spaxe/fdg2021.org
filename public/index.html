      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      The International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG)
      2021 is proud to invite research contributions in the form of papers,
      games and demos, doctoral consortium applications, as well as panel,
      competition, and workshop proposals. We invite contributions from within
      and across any discipline committed to advancing knowledge on the
      foundations of games: computer science and engineering, humanities and
      social sciences, arts and design, mathematics and natural sciences. Papers
      and Games-and-Demos submissions will receive double-blind peer reviews.
      Workshops, panels, competitions, and all other submissions will be
      single-blind. Games and Demos are guaranteed two reviews. There will be no
      rebuttal. As in previous years, we aim to publish the FDG 2021 proceedings
      in the ACM Digital Library. â€‹All contributions should be submitted using
      EasyChair https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=fdg2021.
